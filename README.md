# Solving the Quantum Difference Equation for Equivariant  K -Theory of  $Gr(k, n)$ 

# Overview

This project focuses on solving the quantum difference equation for the equivariant  K -theory of the Grassmannian  \text{Gr}(k, n) . The goal is to explore the rich combinatorial and geometric structure of the quantum  K -theory of the Grassmannian and provide computational tools for working with its quantum difference equations.

# Features
	•	Implementation of the quantum difference equation for  K_T(\text{Gr}(k, n)) .
	•	Computation of quantum  K -theory structure constants.
	•	Connections to Schubert calculus and symmetric functions.
	•	Symbolic and numerical approaches for solving the difference equation.

 # Usage
 After cloning the repository, the mw file can be opened in maple and used as maple worksheet. Alternatively, one can use python, viewing the file with sage.

 The pieriktheory_o1V2.mw file is the main file that solves the QDE in the K theory. The other files help dissect pieces, with notes in the file describing its function. For instance, LRcalcNN is a program to do the littlewood-richardson rule in the nonequivariant cohomology case. It also creates the matrix representing the operation of quantum multiplication by the schubert class corresponding to one box partition.
